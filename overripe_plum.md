It did something _new_ (to me) with parentheses.
The only punctuation is parentheses, in fact[^3].
The core of the story is the first four words - the narrator stepped on a plum.
The rest of the post is adding context, and repeating the context wherever it
applies as more context is added.

We learn that the narrator was hungover stepped out of their car on a hot day
and stepped on an overripe plum which burst.
We're then provided a moral, a litany of hope: "still we find ways to keep
ourselves going from day to day".

We're given context objectively: it's 97 degrees out. The car is black.
They're hungover. They were throwing up all morning. The plum was overripe.
They were barefoot. The pants were too long. And cetera.
We never hear "and I hated that" or "and it brought me to tears".
We're left to our devices to put ourselves in their shoes[^4] and feel that
ourselves.

That way, the message of hope is contrasted not with the content of the story,
but with the feeling evoked in each of us.
I did not step on a plum (overripe plum) (barefoot) on a hot day when I was
hungover.
I'm lucky to not have.
But I have had moments like this. We all have our own plums (overripe plums).
Still we find ways to keep ourselves going from day to day.

## More of This
Of course, none of this is actually new.
We as a species have been telling stories and playing with punctuation.
Yet I've had trouble finding some concrete examples of this specific
combination. Where can I find prose or poetry which uses parentheses

1. a lot
1. with the same content repeatedly?

Of course, this post is a popular post on the internet, so there is emulation.

There are a couple posts on tumblr that I know of that do just that.
Here, we have someone with the opportunity to impress someone while being
helpful (an excerpt):

> She comes out a little bit later to say that the soap dispenser is empty.
> She's holding her hands up—purple nail polish—clearly distressed by her
> exposure to filth and unwilling to touch anything until that can be fixed. I
> am nothing if not eager to help (knight complex) (beautiful) (purple nail
> polish) so I leap up and run to the supply room for the refill bottle.
>
> I wedge the bathroom door open, you know, for her comfort, she's standing
> there  (beautiful) watching me, I'm silently pretending that she must be
> secretly impressed by my ring of keys (like the song), I've got a bit of a
> swagger on maybe (purple nail polish). I open the soap dispenser expecting an
> empty canister. It doesn't look empty. I stick my fingers in (looks can be
> deceiving) and it's completely full, freshly refilled, now I'm suddenly aware
> that she's still watching me over my shoulder and I'm sticking my fingers
> into a hole (purple nail polish) and ha-ha-ha, it's only a little suggestive
> with the soap, forget about it.

This next one is an explicit reference:

Unlike the previous two, this one has explicit insight into the author's
emotional state.

There are surely more, but here's the third I saw that got this really stuck in
my brain:

This has become a listicle. Sorry.

## But What Is *This*?

What are the roots of the "overripe plum" style? After some cursory research,
I've found that parentheses - the punctuation - are avoided except in certain
academic contexts.
But parentheses (the rhetorical device; an aside or parenthetical clause) are
still used - just not quite like this.

*Lolita* contains a famous example of a parenthesis what achieves a similar
mood:

> My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I
> was three [...]

This parenthesis does a lot of work and concisely gives vivid context to a
relatively mundane story (picnic, lightning).
But it's missing the repetition.
Nabokov doesn't continue introducing new details, and does not bring up the
picnic or lightning to illustrate how those things affect the broader story.
That would look something like:

> My mother (photogenic) died in an accident (freak accident)(picnic,
> lightning) when I was three (picnic with my mother) [...]

And then each of those would crop up again a few times before the narrator
finished talking about his mother's death.

### A Small Place

The closest I can find (this is a difficult topic to search without consulting
actually well-read people) is Jamaica Kincaid's book *A Small Place*[^8].
Kincaid uses parentheses (delimited by parentheses or commas or hyphens)
liberally, but not as densely as to be overripe-plum-esque.

Early on, when referring to riding with typically reckless drivers:

> This might frighten you (you are on your holiday; you are a tourist); this
> might excite you (you are on your holiday; you are a tourist), though if you
> are from New York and take taxis you are used to this style of driving [...]

When referring to the medical options available to you as a visitor:

> Will you be comforted to know that the hospital is staffed with doctors that
> no Antiguan trusts; that Antiguans always say about the doctors "I don't want
> them near me", that Antiguans refer to them not as doctors but as "the three
> men" (there are three of them) [...]

Describing a merchant family the locals hate:

> Now they own a lot of Antigua; they regularly lend money to the government,
> they build enormous (for Antigua), ugly (for Antigua), concrete buildings in
> Antigua's capital [...]

Illustrating the ugliness of being a tourist:

> [...] behind their closed doors they laugh at your strangeness (you do not
> look the way they look); the physical sight of you does not please them; you
> have bad manners (it is their custom to eat their food with their hands; you
> try eating their way, you look silly; you try eating the way you always eat,
> you look silly); they do not like the way you speak (you have an accent);
> they collapse helpless from laughter, mimicking the way they imagine you must
> look as you carry out some everyday bodily function.

This latter passage includes the run-on aspect of the overripe peach post -
it's part of a very long sentence, punctuated with semicolons and hyphens and
parentheses and commas, which has an immersive effect, and lends itself to
empathizing with the tourist subject.

*A Small Place* is as close as I can find before the overripe plum post.
There is a closer adherence to grammar and repeated parentheses are limited to
a couple repetitions. But the mood is similar - here is a simple story, and
without letting the reader rest here is more context (and then some more).

### Cosmicomics

Italo Calvino's *Cosmicomics*[^9] includes some repeated parentheses (at least
in my translation).
The purpose in those is to add upon the conceit that the narrator was "really
there", and so they helpfully (somewhat condescendingly) add some context that
would be obvious to them.

> [...] that might contain something (or, let's say, the world) or contain only
> me, or me in relation to something (or to the world), or something (the
> world) without me any more.

### More

I'm certain there are more examples! This article is interactive. Contact me
somehow if you know of more roots for the "overripe plum" style.
